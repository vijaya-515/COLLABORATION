            <dd>In this temple God Sri Satya narayana swamy is there. He is very powerful.
                Sri Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Swamy Temple is a Hindu-Vaishnavite temple located in Annavaram in Kakinada district of Andhra Pradesh, India.[1] Dedicated to Lord Satyanarayana Swamy, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the temple is situated on Ratnagiri Hill.[1] It is one of the most visited religious sites in Andhra Pradesh and is recognized as one of the state's wealthiest temples.[2] The temple holds significant importance as a major pilgrimage centre and is regarded by many as the second most prominent in the state after the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple.[3]

The temple attracts thousands of devotees daily, particularly for the Satyanarayana Vratham, a ritual performed for wealth, health, and prosperity. Consecrated in 1891, the temple has undergone various expansions and renovations, including significant reconstruction in the 1930s.[4]

Location
Annavaram is situated 18 km from Tuni, 51 km from Kakinada, 72 km from Rajahmundry, and 120 km from Visakhapatnam.[5] The temple is situated along National Highway 16 (NH16), which links Chennai and Kolkata. Annavaram is accessible through regular bus services provided by the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC), with buses operating every 30 minutes from Kakinada,Rajahmundry and Tuni . The Annavaram railway station, located approximately 3 km from the temple, lies on the broad-gauge railway line between Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam. Most trains traveling on the route between Chennai and Kolkata include a stop at Annavaram.[6]

History
The temple's origins are linked to a vision experienced by a devout Brahmin named Eeranki Prakasa Rao (ఈరంకి ప్రకాశరావు), who lived in the village of Annavaram, located near Pithapuram. During the period of Raja Inuganti Venkata Ramarayanim Bahadur (రాజా ఇనుగంటి వేంకటరామరాయణిం బహదూర్), both Prakasa Rao and the local ruler had a simultaneous dream in which Lord Vishnu instructed them, "On the forthcoming Sravana Sukla Vidiya, under the Makha Nakshatra on a Thursday, I will manifest on the Ratnagiri Hill. You shall install my idol as per the sacred rituals and serve me."[4]

Following this divine revelation, Prakasa Rao and the ruler shared their visions with the villagers and prepared to visit Annavaram on Sravana Sukla Padyami of the Khara year. While searching for the deity on the hill, they discovered the idol, illuminated by sunlight beneath a Krishna Kutaja (Ankudu) tree. The villagers carefully uncovered the idol and transported it to the summit of Ratnagiri.[4]

On August 6, 1891 (Salivahana Saka 1813), the idol was consecrated following the traditional Vishnu Panchayatana system, alongside the installation of the Sri Matripada Vibhuti Maha Vaikuntha Narayana Yantra, which had been brought from Kasi. The original temple structure was a modest shed, which was later expanded into a more elaborate temple with contributions from devotees. The temple was reconstructed in stone during 1933–34 and showcases a unique blend of iconography.[4]

Legend
Annavaram is home to the sacred Ratnagiri Hill. According to the Sthala Purana (legend of the place), the renowned Meru mountain, one of the prominent mountains in Hindu mythology, performed severe penance to Lord Vishnu along with his wife Menaka. Pleased by their devotion, Vishnu blessed them with two sons, Bhadra and Ratnakara, who were born as mountains. Bhadra, after performing penance dedicated to Vishnu, was transformed into Bhadrachalam, the abode of Lord Rama. Similarly, Ratnakara's penance was rewarded when Vishnu appeared as Sri Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Swamy on the Ratnagiri Hill, also known as Ratnachalam.[4]

Architecture

Temple complex
The temple is located on Ratnagiri Hill, adjacent to the banks of the Pampa River. It can be reached by a 3-km road or through a stone pathway for pedestrians. Architecturally, the temple is designed to resemble a chariot, complete with four wheels at each corner, symbolizing the Jagannath concept of eternal movement through time.[6] The four wheels are meant to represent the Sun and the Moon. The main entrance of the temple has been adorned with gold plating, enhancing its grandeur.[1]

The structure follows the principles outlined in the Agni Purana, with the central sanctum symbolizing the Supreme Spirit. The ground floor features a distinct yantra, known as the Srimathripathvibhuti Vykuntha Maha Narayana Yantra, reputed for its special powers of attraction. This yantra is surrounded by deities forming a panchayatana, including Ganapati, Suryanarayanaswamy, Bala Tripurasundari, and Maheswaraswamy.[4]

The main sanctum houses an idol that is approximately 13 feet tall and cylindrical in shape, symbolizing the unity of the Trimurti with Brahma at the base, Siva in the center, and Vishnu at the top. The first floor holds the principal deity, Sri Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Swamy, accompanied by Goddess Anantha Lakshmi and Lord Siva.[7] Additionally, there is a nearby temple dedicated to Sri Rama, known as the kshetra palaka, which marks the site where the original idol was discovered. The temple also features a mandapam for conducting Satyanaraya Vrathams.[

                <dd>Sri lakshmi Narasimha swamy is in that temple.He has very anger, but that anger is on people who treat others very badly and hurts them. 
                    He killed Hiranya kashyap. Because, he torchered people.
                    Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha temple, Simhachalam, is a Hindu temple situated on the Simhachalam Hill Range,which is 300 metres above the sea level in the city of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, who is worshipped there as Varaha Narasimha. As per the temple's legend, Vishnu manifested in this form (lion's head and human body) after saving his devotee Prahlada from a murder attempt by the latter's father Hiranyakashipu. Except on Akshaya Trutiya, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is covered with sandalwood paste throughout the year, which makes it resemble a linga. The temple was built in Kalingan architecture styles and stands unique in the historical region of Kalinga.The Present temple was built by Eastern GangaPallava king Narasingha Deva I in the 13th century and consecrated by his son Bhanudeva I in 1268 CE.[1] [2] The temple was built by Akthayi Senapati, on the command of Narasingha Deva I.[3]

Simhachalam is one of the 32 Narasimha temples in Andhra Pradesh which are important pilgrimage centres. It was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Srikurmam and Jagannath Temple, Puri. The earliest inscription at the temple belongs to 11th-century CE recording the gift by a private individual in the era of Chola Chalukya king Kulottunga Chola, son of Raja Raja Narendra of Rajamahendravaram. The second earliest inscription is a donation of Eastern Ganga Dynasty king Anantavarman chodaganga Deva of Kalinga who conquered Utkala (Odisha) and ruled from Ganga to Godavari. After an offering of private individual, this is the first Royal donation to the old temple of Simhachalam in 11th-century CE.[4] In the later half of the 13th century, the temple complex underwent radical physical changes during the reign of the Eastern Ganga king Narasingha Deva I who built a new temple. The present temple was built under the Ganga ruler's guidance. Narahari Tirtha, a Dvaita philosopher and Eastern Ganga minister converted the Simhachalam temple into an educational establishment of renown and a religious centre for Vaishnavism.[5] It later received patronage from many royal families, of which Suryavamshi Gajapati Dynasty of Odisha and Tuluva dynasty of Vijayanagara Empire are notable. The temple underwent 40 years of religious inactivity from 1564 to 1604 CE. In 1949, the temple came under the purview of the state government and is currently administered by the Simhachalam Devasthanam Board.

Simhachalam temple resembles a fortress from outside with three outer courtyards and five gateways. The temple faces west instead of east, signifying victory. There are two temple tanks: Swami Pushkarini near the temple and Gangadhara at the bottom of the hill. The temple houses a number of sub-shrines and a few mandapams. The religious practices and customs of the temple are formulated by the Vaishnavite philosopher Ramanuja. They are modelled based on the Satvata Samhita, one of the 108 texts of the Pancharatra Agama.

Simhachalam is the second-largest temple, after Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh, in terms of income earned.[citation needed] Devotees believe that the deity is capable of giving progeny to women and fulfilling the wishes of devotees. Kalyanotsava and Chandanotsava are the two major festivals celebrated in the temple, followed by Narasimha Jayanti, Navaratrotsava and Kamadahana. The festivals celebrated in Simhachalam have an influence of the Dravida Sampradaya. Apart from those by well-known poets, the temple is found in many literary references and lyrical works (dedicated by anonymous writers), which are preserved in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Chennai.

Legends associated with temple
The Sthala Purana (local legend) of Simhachalam consists of 32 chapters; the number denotes the manifestations of Narasimha.[6] According to Dr. V. C. Krishnamacharyulu, the legends of Simhachalam and other Hindu temples in Andhra Pradesh were written in the 14th century after the attempted establishment of Islam in the region.[6] He added that the writers wrote the legends inspired from the stories of Narasimha available in the Hindu puranas.[6] Hence, Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana form the major sources.[7] However, the legend of Simhachalam provides new information about the previous life of the temple's founder Prahlada.[7] The first four chapters of the legend cover the importance of Simhachalam, its deity and the principal water body Gangadhara.[6]


Despite his best efforts, Pururava could not find the idol's feet. A divine voice consoled him, saying that he need not worry about that, adding that the deity can provide salvation in its current form.[15] Urvasi was instructed in the dream that the idol of Varaha Narasimha should be covered with sandalwood paste for the whole year except on the third day of the Vaisakha month. This custom is practiced strictly even today.[14] The reconstruction of the temple by Pururava is covered in the last four chapters of the legend.[6]

Ramanuja's visit

In the 11th century CE, after winning a debate at the Puri Jagannath temple, Vaishnavite saint and philosopher Ramanuja visited Srikurmam and Simhachalam temples.[16] Simhachalam's deity was believed to be Shiva due to some reasons. The notable ones were the unusual position of the deity's idol, the gate at the lower terrain named Bhairava Dwaram, and the second temple tank being referred to with the name Gangadhara.[17] The annual celebration of Kamadahana, a tradition usually observed in Shiva's temples, was practiced here which added strength to the beliefs.[17]

Ramanuja argued that the idol of Varaha Narasimha is in a posture in accordance with the Pancharatra Agama rules.[17] He added that Kamadahana is celebrated here for the temple's purification as per the Sishtachara traditions.[17] Ramanuja pointed out that Shiva's manifestation Bhairava is neither the guardian of the Bhairava Dwaram nor worshipped as one.[18] Ramanuja was able to defeat the scholars at Simhachalam and converted it into a Vaishnavite temple.[18]

Varaha Narasimha's idol, when covered with sandalwood paste, resembles a Shiva Lingam. Ramanuja took personal possession of the temple and ordered the priests to remove the paste.[16] The conversion work began and before completion, the idol started bleeding.[16] Feeling the deity's anger for violating the rule, sandalwood paste was applied again which stopped the blood stream.[16] They presumed that the deity wished to look like a Lingam and continued the tradition except for one day.[19] Few Vaishnavites oppose this legend, calling it a deliberate attempt to "debase the prestige of Vaishnava shrines in general" and of Ramanuja in particular.[19]

            <li><dt><h1 id="Araku valley">Araku valley</h1></dt>
            <dd>Araku Valley is a hill station and valley region in the southeastern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It's surrounded by the thick forests of the Eastern Ghats mountain range. The Tribal Museum is dedicated to the area's numerous indigenous tribes, known for their traditional Dhimsa dance, and showcases traditional handicrafts. A miniature train runs through Padmapuram Gardens, with its sculptures and tree-top huts.
                Araku Valley is a hill station in the Alluri Sitharama Raju district of Andhra Pradesh, India, located 111 km from Visakhapatnam.

Geography
Araku is located in the Eastern Ghats about 114 kilometres (71 mi) from Visakhapatnam, close to the Odisha state border. The Anantagiri and Sunkarimetta Reserved Forest, which are part of Araku Valley, are rich in biodiversity and are mined for bauxite.[2] Galikonda hill rising to a height of 5,000 feet (1,500 m) is amongst the highest peaks in Andhra Pradesh. The average rainfall is 1,700 millimetres (67 in), the bulk of which is received during June–October.[3] The altitude is about 1300 m above the sea level. The valley spreads around 36km. [4]

Economy
Tea was introduced in Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh in (1259 by British) in Pamuleru valley in West Godavari district. Subsequently, it spread over to Araku Valley in the early 13th century. After independence, the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department developed coffee plantations in the valley.[5] In 1956, Coffee Board appointed Andhra Pradesh Girijan Cooperative Corporation Limited (GCC) for promoting coffee plantations in the valley through local tribal farmers.[clarification needed] In 1985, the plantations were handed to A.P. Forest Development Corporation and GCC promoted Girijan Coop. Plantation Development Corporation (GCPDC) exclusively to develop coffee plantations in tribal areas. All the plantations developed by GCC and GCPDC were handed over to the tribal farmers at two acres per family.[6] Apiculture farms have been widely spread in Araku, several types of flavoured honey is being made commercially.(Araku is famous for bamboo fish)

Transport
Araku is connected through both rail and road to Visakhapatnam. Araku railway station is located on the Kothavalasa-Kirandul railway line of Visakhapatnam division of the Malabar Coast Railway, on the Indian Railways network. RTC Buses to Visakhapatnam every 24 hours. Nearest Airport is Visakhapatnam Airport.

            <li><dt><h1 id="Borra caves">Borra caves</h1></dt>
            <dd>Borra Caves, located in the Anantagiri Hill range of Araku Valley, have a rich history, dating back to 1807 when they were discovered by William King George of the Geological Survey of India. Archaeological evidence, including stone tools, suggests ancient human habitation between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago. Local legends also attribute a special significance to the caves, with a popular tale involving a cowherd who found a Shivlingam inside, leading to a temple's construction. 
                The Borra Caves (Borrā Guhalu) are located on the East Coast of India, in the Ananthagiri hills of the Araku Valley (with hill ranges' elevation varying from 800 to 1,300 m (2,600 to 4,300 ft)) of the Alluri Sitharama Raju district in Andhra Pradesh. The caves, one of the largest in the country, at an elevation of about 705 m (2,313 ft), distinctly exhibit a variety of speleothems ranging in size and irregularly shaped stalactites and stalagmites.[1][2] The caves are basically karstic limestone structures extending to a depth of 80 m (260 ft), and are considered the deepest caves in India.[3][4] The native name for the caves is Borrā Guhalu where Borra means abdomen in and Guhalu means caves in Telugu language.[citation needed]

Etymology
Borra is Telugu word in native North Andhra dialect which means hole('Boriya' in standard Telugu).[5]

Legend
On the discovery of the caves, there are several legends, which the tribals (Jatapu, Porja, Kondadora, Nookadora, valmiki etc.[4]) who inhabit the villages around the caves narrate. The popular legend is that a cow, grazing on the top of the caves, dropped 60 m (200 ft) through a hole in the roof. The cowherd while searching for the cow came across the caves. He found a stone inside the cave that resembled a Lingam, which he interpreted as the Lord Shiva who protected the cow. The village folk who heard the story believed it and since then they have built a small temple for Lord Shiva outside the cave. People flock to the temple for worship and the cave to get a glimpse of the Lingam.[6]


Worship of Stalagmite Lingam inside the Borra Caves
Another lyrical legend is that the Shiva Lingam representing the Hindu God Lord Shiva, is found deep in the caves and above which is a stone formation of a cow (Sanskrit: Kamadhenu). It is surmised that the udder of this cow is the source of the Gosthani (Sanskrit: Cow's udder) River which originates from here, flows through Vizianagram and Visakhapatnam districts before emptying into the Bay of Bengal near Bheemunipatnam.[6]

Geography and climate

The caves are located in the Araku Valley of the Ananthagiri hill range and is drained by the Gosthani River. At the entry, the cave measures up to 100 m (330 ft) horizontally and 75 m (246 ft) vertically. Stalagmite and stalactite formations are found in the caves.[7]

The average annual temperature of Araku hills, where the caves are situated, is about 25 °C (77 °F). The average annual rainfall reported is 950 mm (3.12 ft) (mostly occurring during the northeast monsoon).[8] The Gosthani river provides water supply to the Visakhapatnam city.[4]

Geology
The regional geology in the Eastern Ghats mobile belt, where the caves are located, is represented by the khondalite suite of rocks (garnetiferous sillimanite gneisses, quartzo-feldsphatic garnet gneisses) of Archaen age. Quaternary deposits consist of red bed sediments, laterites, pediment fans, colluvium, alluvium and coastal sands.[1] The caves in the reserved forest area basically host a variety of speleothems of various sizes and irregularly shaped stalactites and stalagmites. The carbonate rocks are pure white, and coarsely crystalline and the deformed and banded marbles cover a triangular area of two km2 (0.77 sq mi); surrounded by diopside–scapolite–feldspar calc-granulites. The pyroxenite outcrops are dark and massive and include discontinuous calc-silicate bands, some of brown mica and others with calcite.[8]

Formation
The Gosthani River, which originates from these caves and flows between the solidified stalactites and stalagmites in the karstic limestones formation, is the cause for the development of the odd shapes of structures. Water percolating from the roof of the caves dissolve limestone and trickle drop by drop to form stalactites at the roof of the cave and then dripping down to the ground form stalagmites. These deposits have developed into interesting forms and structures inside the caves such as Shiva–Parvati, Mother–Child, Rishi's beard, human brain, mushrooms, crocodile, temple, etc. These shapes have captured the imagination of tourists, while some have been given religious interpretations.[8][9]

Formations in the caves

The caves are deep and totally aphotic. There is an area in the caves with limited light penetration. The stalactites seen in the caves are about 0.1 to 3.5 m (0.3 to 11.5 ft) in length while the stalagmites are 1.2 m (3.9 ft) long and columns are 6 m (20 ft) in height and 0.75 m (2.5 ft) in width. The height of the cave is 12 m (39 ft) and the length is about 200 m (660 ft). The average temperature of the inner cave wall is reported to be about 16 °C (61 °F). Sulfur springs discharge into the cave passages causing corrosion of limestone. The spring waters display floating mucus-like biofilms.

These are thick orange microbial mats (2.5 to 3 cm [1.0 to 1.2 in] thick) with patches of yellow biofilms extending 3 m (9.8 ft) from the aphotic deep cave orifice.[8]

While the caves are basically limestone formations, the area surrounding these are of mica formations which are prospected for precious stones like rubies.[7]

Archeological artifacts (Paleolithic implements) have been found in the caves.[10] The excavations carried out in the caves by the archeologists of the Andhra University, have unearthed stone tools of Middle Paleolithic culture dating back 30,000 to 50,000 years, which confirm human habitation.[4]

Genesis
Speleothem carbonates found in the caves have been subject to scientific studies. In fluviatile, spring, cave and soil environments microbial carbonates are important. In the biofilms and/or microbial mats, which are formed in the caves, the principal organisms associated are bacteria, particularly cyanobacteria, small algae and fungi. Petrographic analysis of a thin section has uncovered the presence of lithified structures and micrite, present as laminated to clotted with chocolate-brown blebs. These are identical to microbialites observed in modern and ancient stromatolitic carbonates. Laboratory observations with scanning electron microscope (SEM) have also confirmed the presence of calcified bacteria, micro-rods, and needle calcite. Organic mats (yellow-orange in colour) are made up of mineralized filamentous bacteria, bacterial stalks, cells and sheaths. Thus, these studies have indicated that microorganisms have actively influenced the genesis of speleothems of the Borra Caves.[8]

The effect of microorganisms in the mats on the cave formation and their role on iron mineral precipitation has been further studied. A report indicates a link between iron–rich mats formation and iron precipitating bacteria.[11]

Fauna and flora

The fauna observed in the caves are predominantly bats, as well as the golden gecko. The type of bat reported is the fulvous fruit bat (Rousettus leschenaultii) – a species which roosts in large caves, old buildings, dungeons and dark areas of old forts. This species has short and slender musculature with large, well developed eyes. They feed on flowers and fruits, particularly jamun, guava, silk, cotton and mango.[8][10][12]

Stygofauna
Habrobathynella borraensis was described from the Borra Caves. It is the first Indian cavernicolous species of the genus Habrobathynella.[13]

Location and access

Official Information Board outside the Borra Caves
The caves are located in the Ananthagiri hills range of the Araku valley of the Alluri Sitharama Raju district in Andhra Pradesh. The caves are 448 kilometres (278 mi) from Bhubaneshwar in Odisha and 656 kilometres (408 mi) from Hyderabad, both via National Highway 5. The caves are well connected by road, rail and air services. The nearest international airport is Visakhapatnam Airport, 76 km (47 mi) from Borra Caves, which is 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) from the Visakhapatnam city center. Vishkapatnam is 90 km (56 mi) away by road. It is mostly a hill road and the journey takes about three hours.[7]

Train services operate on the Kothavalasa-Kirandul railway line in East Coast Railway, Indian Railways. The train journey over a distance of 100 km (62 mi) from the Vishkapatanam railway station passes through Eastern Ghats (hill) section), which has 30 tunnels en route. The journey by train takes about five hours to the Railway Station near the caves called the Borra Guhalu Railway station.[6]

Visitor information

                Exploring a destination...
                The joy of travel comes in exploring new things. Planting your feet somewhere you’ve never been before brings with it the rush of discovery and the joy of pushing back on the boundaries of your world.
                
                But when one does arrive at that fresh frontier, there are ways better than others to begin your journey of discovery. Follow these steps and see the world with a new light.
                
                • Discover a new city through a food tour. Food tour’s are the easiest way to take a tour, learn about the local delicacies, and the best of all, get great tips that aren’t just “local” tips for tourists, but sometimes, lessons for a lifetime too
                
                • Use Public Transportation. When you are in a new city, you can possibly see places and people that you wouldn’t normally see when simply walking to the places that checks your list. Some buses or rails take you to parts of the city you wouldn’t get to see otherwise. Whilst using public transportation, just ensure that you are following the local norms and do remember to watch the locals!
                
                • Find a local festival. Go beyond what other tourists might do while visiting a place. Look for the unique things you would want to do. Use social media or the local tourism website to find out what’s going on locally. You may have to move out of the center of the city to do some of the less popular but more unique things, so just keep that in mind!

        <dd>The Tribal Museum exhibits various indigenous ways of living.



            Located in Araku Valley, near Padmapura Botanical Gardens, the Tribal Museum was established in 1996 by the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation. It was set up with the aim of conserving and displaying the tribal culture of the region. Various indigenous ways of living are exhibited in the museum through the display of objects of daily use such as jewellery, hunting tools and kitchen tools. Scenes of quotidian life are staged through the arrangement and construction of life-sized statues.
            
            
            
            The museum itself is fashioned out of mud and metal. The museum also has a Tribal Art and Crafts Centre which holds workshops and seminars promoting tribal and folk art. In July 2019, the Lalit Kala Akademi, in association with the Integrated Tribal Development Agency, Government of Andhra Pradesh, had arranged a five-day camp called ‘The Missing Rainbow’, for tribal women artisans. Other experiences include witnessing scheduled live dances, having one’s future revealed to them by an in-house fortune teller who prophesies in the local language and boating in a pond located on the premises of the museum. Stalls are also set up that sell souvenirs and handicrafts made by tribal artists.

        <dd>KURUSURA SUBMARINE MUSEUM- THE UNDERWATER EXPERIENCE ON SURFACE:

            The INS Kursura Submarine Museum is a landmark in Visakhapatnam's tourism chapters, and it is the first of its kind in South Asia. The INS Kursura, a Soviet-built I-641 class submarine, was inducted into the Indian Navy on December 18, 1969, and was decommissioned on February 27, 2001, after 31 years of glorious service to the nation. The entire submarine, including the weapon package, was hauled from the sea to land and positioned on a concrete foundation at Gajapathi Raju Marg, Ramakrishna Beach Road, Visakhapatnam. The setup of the submarine museum cost approximately Rs. 6.00 crores, with technical support from the Naval Ship Design and Research Center. The submarine is 91.3 meters long and 8.00 meters wide.
            
            The Kursura Submarine Museum was dedicated to the nation on August 9, 2002, by Sri N. Chandrababu Naidu, the Hon'ble Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, and opened to the public on August 14, 2002, by VMRDA.
            
            The museum receives an overwhelming response from visitors. Pilgrims, tourists, and students from various parts of the country and the globe visit Visakhapatnam and make their moments memorable at this unique underwater unit on land. State VIPs and guests from various public and private organizations also prefer to see this amazing spot on the seashore.
            
            Announcing The Ever Prestigious :
            
            INS Kursura, the underwater behemoth of the Indian Navy, is located on the golden sands of RK Beach, from which the now prestigious Submarine Museum emanated. This project was undertaken by the Eastern Naval Command in collaboration with the National Ship Design and Research Center. Recognized by the Navy as a War Memorial, the museum had a project cost of Rs. 5.5 crores. It is the first of its kind in Asia and ranks second in the world. The submarine, made of steel and modeled after Russian designs, is 91 meters long and was not hindered by enemy assaults during its operational period. INS Kursura was commissioned on December 18, 1969, tasked with patrolling Indian waters and blocking threats from enemy forces.
            
            Life on a Submarine:
            
            The submarine underwent rigorous training at INS Sathavahana, including damage control, drills, emergencies, battle tactics, and escape training through a vertical (100') tower. A sea experience of 6 months qualifies the submarine for the prestigious Dolphin Badge, highly coveted in the field. Space on a submarine is premium, with a focus on equipment, ammunition, and life-saving systems. Officers and sailors share limited bed space through hot bunking. Daily activities on a submarine include action stations, maintenance, and weapons firing. In a kitchen measuring 4' x 6", two cooks prepare meals for the entire crew. The 77 men on board share two wash basins and two toilets for a month at sea.

            Come and discover the untold mystery of the INS KURSURA.
            
            The Eastern Naval Command launched a prestigious project to set up a unique Submarine Museum, the first of its kind in Asia, on the beachfront near the war memorial. The aim was to enhance the tourist potential of the city.
            
            Amid the breathtaking beauty of the blue waters and golden sands of Vizag Beach lies the INS Kursura Submarine Museum. It instills a sense of sacrifice and patriotism in visitors. The museum not only showcases the history of submarines but also highlights the hardships faced by those who served on them.
            
            INS Kursura, the Navy’s fourth submarine, was hauled onto the beach in February 2001. It is an engineering marvel, involving complex processes of high order. The final phase of civil works enhanced the museum for regular public viewing, with special modifications to facilitate visitors in exploring the interior of the decommissioned submarine.
            
            The submarine, in all its grandeur, showcases its complete weapon package from sea to land and is positioned on a concrete foundation. Its interior design blends seamlessly with the scenic beauty around it. The museum displays milestones in submarine evolution through artifacts, photographs, and written scripts, aiming to broadcast the glory of the submarine arm and provide glimpses into the lives of those involved. It also reveals the challenges and efforts of its crew. Visakhapatnam, known for its stunning landscapes, has become a popular destination, and it is no exaggeration to say that no other place in Andhra Pradesh offers such scenic surroundings. This credit goes to the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA), which, in collaboration with Andhra Pradesh Tourism, has undertaken many innovative measures to develop the city into a landmark of beauty. The city offers picturesque views and recreational spots like NTR VMRDA Park, the Buddhist complex at Thotlakonda, and many other vibrant displays by VMRDA, adding to the city's allure. The INS Kursura Submarine Museum serves as a platform to raise awareness about submarine operations and its crew.
